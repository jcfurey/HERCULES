# How to Use Lidar in HERCULES

HERCULES supports Lidar for multirotors and cars. 

The enablement of lidar and the other lidar settings can be configured via AirSimSettings json.
Please see [general sensors](sensors.md) for information on configruation of general/shared sensor settings.

## Enabling lidar on a vehicle
* By default, lidars are not enabled. To enable lidar, set the SensorType and Enabled attributes in settings json.

```json
    "Lidar1": {
         "SensorType": 6,
         "Enabled" : true,
    }
```

* Multiple lidars can be enabled on a vehicle.

## Ignoring glass and other material types
One can set an object that should be invisible to LIDAR sensors (such as glass) to have no collision for Unreal Traces in order to have it be 'invisible' for lidar sensors.

## Lidar configuration
The following parameters can be configured right now via settings json.

Parameter                 | Description
--------------------------| ------------
NumberOfChannels          | Number of channels/lasers of the lidar. When set to 1 it will act as a 2D horizontal LiDAR and will use the VerticalFOVUpper value as the vertical angle to scan.
Range                     | Range, in meters
MeasurementsPerCycle      | Horizontal resolution. Amount of points in one cycle.
RotationsPerSecond        | Rotations per second
HorizontalFOVStart        | Horizontal FOV start for the lidar, in degrees
HorizontalFOVEnd          | Horizontal FOV end for the lidar, in degrees
VerticalFOVUpper          | Vertical FOV upper limit for the lidar, in degrees
VerticalFOVLower          | Vertical FOV lower limit for the lidar, in degrees
VerticalAngles            | Optional calibrated beam table: the elevation of every channel in degrees (positive up, in channel order). Replaces the even spread between VerticalFOVUpper and VerticalFOVLower and sets NumberOfChannels. See [Calibrated beam tables](#calibrated-beam-tables-ouster).
AzimuthOffsets            | Optional: one azimuth offset per channel in degrees, clockwise seen from above (the sweep's direction), added to the sweep angle.
X Y Z                     | Position of the lidar relative to the vehicle (in NED, in meters)                     
Roll Pitch Yaw            | Orientation of the lidar relative to the vehicle  (in degrees, yaw-pitch-roll order to front vector +X)
GenerateNoise             | Generate and add range-noise based on normal distribution if set to true
MinNoiseStandardDeviation | The standard deviation to generate the noise normal distribution, in meters. This is the minimal noise (at 0 distance)
NoiseDistanceScale        | To scale the noise with distance, set this parameter. This way the minimal noise is scaled depending on the distance compared to total maximum range of the sensor
UpdateFrequency           | Amount of times per second that the sensor should update and calculate the next set of poins
DrawSensor                | Draw the physical sensor in the world on the vehicle with a 3D axes shown where the sensor is
LimitPoints               | Limit the amount of points that can be calculated in one measurement (to work around freezes due to bad performance). Will result in incomplete pointclouds
External                  | Uncouple the sensor from the vehicle. If enabled, the position and orientation will be relative to Unreal world coordinates
ExternalLocal             | When in external mode, if this is enabled the retrieved pose of the sensor will be in Local NED coordinates(from starting position from vehicle) and not converted Unreal NED coordinates which is default

## Calibrated beam tables (Ouster)

Real lidars rarely space their channels evenly. `VerticalAngles` gives the elevation of each
channel and `AzimuthOffsets` the horizontal offset each channel fires at, as a sensor's calibration
reports them. For an Ouster sensor these are the `beam_altitude_angles` and `beam_azimuth_angles` of
its metadata, unchanged: Ouster and HERCULES both sweep clockwise seen from above, and Ouster fires
each beam at the encoder angle minus its beam azimuth angle, so a positive value turns the beam
clockwise in both. Mount the lidar where the Ouster's lidar frame is (`os_lidar` in ouster-ros),
which the encoder angle is measured from. The few millimetres between the lidar origin and the beam
origins (`lidar_origin_to_beam_origin_mm`) are not modelled.

```json
"os1": {
    "SensorType": 6, "Enabled": true,
    "MeasurementsPerCycle": 1024, "RotationsPerSecond": 10, "Range": 120,
    "VerticalAngles": [15.379, 13.236, 11.128, ..., -15.703],
    "AzimuthOffsets": [3.12, 0.92, -1.32, -3.54, ...]
}
```

The [URDF importer](urdf_import.md) writes these from an Ouster metadata file
(`ouster_metadata: os1_metadata.json` on a lidar in its sensor file), together with the columns and
rate of the sensor's `lidar_mode`. Point clouds keep HERCULES' column-major order, all channels of
one azimuth step after the other, in the table's channel order. The GPU lidar (`SensorType` 8) spaces
its channels evenly and does not use these keys.

## Ouster sensors

An Ouster sensor (`SensorType` 12) stands for an Ouster lidar whose rays
[hercules_sensors_ouster](https://github.com/jcfurey/hercules_sensors_ouster) turns into Ouster
packets for ouster-ros. HERCULES does not cast those rays yet (the Unreal side of
hercules_sensors_ouster is future work), so the simulator ignores the sensor. The ROS 2 wrapper
publishes the static transform of its sensor frame, `<vehicle>/<sensor>` (`Husky1/os_top` below),
at the pose given in settings, and no topics. Set ouster-ros's `sensor_frame` parameter to that
frame, so that its point clouds hang off the vehicle in the TF tree. The pose is that of the
Ouster's sensor frame (`os_sensor`), from which ouster-ros places its lidar and IMU frames.

```json
"Husky1": {
    "VehicleType": "PhysXCar",
    "Sensors": {
        "os_top": {
            "SensorType": 12, "Enabled": true,
            "X": 0.1, "Y": 0, "Z": -0.6, "Roll": 0, "Pitch": 0, "Yaw": 0,
            "HostAddress": "127.0.0.1", "HostPort": 7600
        }
    }
}
```

See [Ouster Sensor](settings.md#ouster-sensor) for its keys and their defaults. The host and
`os_cloud` start with
`ros2 launch hercules_sensors_ouster hercules_ouster.launch.py metadata:=<sensor.json> sensor_frame:=Husky1/os_top`;
the host listens on `HostPort` for the simulator.

## Casting rays on the GPU

Where the project has hardware ray tracing enabled and the GPU supports inline ray tracing (DirectX 12 or Vulkan ray tracing, for example an NVIDIA RTX card), the lidar casts its rays on the GPU against the scene's ray tracing structure instead of tracing them one by one on the CPU. The rays, points, labels and noise are the same; in a test in a Cesium city the GPU and CPU point clouds matched to 0.01 cm (median) with identical labels, while the simulator used about 5 fewer CPU cores and lost its lidar frame-time spikes. The game logs which way each lidar casts (`LiDAR on Drone1: rays cast on the GPU`).

The GPU rays follow the CPU traces' rules: objects that ignore the visibility channel are passed through, objects whose physical material is `Lidar_Ignore_PhysicalMaterial` are resolved exactly as on the CPU, and each point is labelled with the actor hit. They hit what is rendered, so an invisible collider (for example a hidden blocking volume) does not return points, while the CPU traces would see it. A scan is reported a few rendered frames after its rays were cast. The first GPU-cast scan turns off ray tracing culling around the camera (`r.RayTracing.Culling 0`), so that geometry near robots away from the camera is not missing.

To trace on the CPU instead, set the console variable `airsim.Lidar.GpuRayTracing 0` (from the console, `simRunConsoleCommand`, or `-ExecCmds="airsim.Lidar.GpuRayTracing 0"` on the command line). Without hardware ray tracing, lidars always trace on the CPU.

## Server side visualization for debugging

By default, the lidar points are not drawn on the viewport. To enable the drawing of hit laser points on the viewport, please enable setting `DrawDebugPoints` via settings json.

```json
    "Lidar1": {
         ...
         "DrawDebugPoints": true
    },
```

## Client API 

Use `getLidarData(sensor name, vehicle name)` API to retrieve the Lidar data. The API returns a full scan Point-Cloud as a flat array of floats along with the timestamp of the capture and lidar pose.

* **Point-Cloud:** The floats represent [x,y,z] coordinate for each point hit within the range in the last scan in NED format. It will be [0,0,0] for a laser that didn't get any reflection (out of range).
* **Pose:** Default: Sensor pose in the vehicle frame / External: If set to `External`(see table) the coordinates will be in either Unreal NED when `ExternalLocal` is `false` or Local NED (from starting position from vehicle) when `ExternalLocal` is `true`.
* **Groundtruth:** For each point of the Point-Cloud a label string is kept that has the name of the object that the point belongs to a laser that didn't reflect anything will have label _out_of_range_.
